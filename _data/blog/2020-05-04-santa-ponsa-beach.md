to Santa Ponsa Marina, in what would be the start of his conquest of Mallorca.
A large stone cross going back to 1229 memorializes the happening at this place
named after the Roman villa called Sancta Pontiac.</p>

small pebble beach alongside Santa Ponsa’s resort on Mallorca’s west coast has
infamously clear waters and a fairly rocky coastline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>−&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A popular beach among the locals, it
is just 40 metres long and averaging 10 metres in width</p>

<p>−&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gentle slope leads from the beach
to the sea, and you will find few waves throughout the summer season</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>−&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you will find though while
enjoying the shallow sea bed, are the Posidonia meadows. This sea grass is
endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, and exclusively found in this region</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>−&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rent a hammock and live the
Mediterranean life or take the stairs to wallow a while in the crystal-clear
sea waters</p>

area, a bathing flag, a lifeguard and even a medical area offered by the
Spanish Red Cross.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

<h2>Information about Santa
Ponsa Beach.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: With approximate dimensions of 520m long and
100m wide (average) is suitable for sand games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Zones</strong>: It has a wooded area (pines), which provide
shade that will go well for us to take a break for the picnic and feel the sea
breeze. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>On the
other side, it has a broader area where the composition of the sand is more
compact, ideal for soccer ball games, where we do not want the ball to bounce
us so much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

<h2>Santa Ponsa Beach Sand
Type.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>White sand,
fine and looseness. We will not find stones or biological remains too big, as
they can be shells. So beautiful fine sand will predominate all over the beach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>In other
words, it is soft sand to step on, ideal for children, where they will not find
any problem for their delicate feet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>We have
already said it, but the beach of Santa Ponsa is ideal for the whole family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<h3>Red Cross Medical Zone.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>On Santa
Ponsa beach, in the center, you will find a Spanish Red Cross house where they
will be able to help you if you need it. Even though it is a very safe beach,
accidents often occur due to fortuitous factors or factors that are beyond our
reach. For example, a sprained ankle, a jellyfish bite, sharp objects stuck in
the foot, burns or sunstroke, are some of the most common care by medical
services on all beaches. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>The good
news is that you will have quick attention if any of these things happen to you
on this beach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

<h2>Access to Santa Ponsa
Beach.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>To get to
Santa Ponsa beach, you will have to go to the south of the village, obviously
towards the sea. Generally, you will do it by going down the avenue Rei Jaume I
where you will arrive at the roundabout with the taxi stop, and bus. From there
you will be able to see the beach, but you will have to go along Via Puig de
Galatzo to access it. The whole street, which is parallel to the beach, has
direct access to Santa Ponsa beach. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Also, the
area closest to the roundabout has access for wheelchairs or baby carriages, as
it has a wooden walkway that leads up to a few meters from the seashore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>So we can
say that <em>the beach of Santa Ponsa has
excellent accessibility</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<h3>Bars, Restaurants,
Supermarkets and other services available on the beach.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>There are
bars with direct access to the beach</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Restaurants,
supermarkets, tobacco shop, and other services can be found “almost” on the
beach, but you will have to cross the street named above, “Via Puig de
Galatzo.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>You can find
everything you need and more, from restaurants, toys, shovels, inflatable
mattresses, balls, creams, ice cream, tobacco, soft drinks and anything you
could buy in a supermarket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
